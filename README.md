# Overview
This github will contain all command files that I have created, each vary in it's ability to be utilized.

## Contributions
Please read CONTRIBUTIONS.md if you wish to make any modifications, as this will contain how to contribute and liability.

## Executing Files
These files are intended for Linux shell, and may only work on specific channels/releases. You may also need to use a command to change the file's permission in order to execute it, which can be done using the following commands:
```sh
  # Replace filename with the path to the file
  chmod +x <filename>
```
