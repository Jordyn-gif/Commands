## Bug Spotting
If you have found a bug, or an issue with a command file, please open an [**Issue**](https://github.com/Jordyn-gif/Commands/issues/new). Please make sure that the following applies:
- An issue has not already been opened for the bug / problem.
- New issues should make sense, and should have steps to easily reproduce the bug or problem

## Pull Requests
You may create a pull request if you wish to help fix an opened issue, or contribute to the command base. Pull requests should:
- **Be safe to execute, and should not contain malicious code or have obscene language**
- Have code that is easy to read and productive - no part of code may be obfuscate, or abstain from the original objective of the command.
